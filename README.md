# AVWX
Aviation weather site for personal/internal use

This is a personal web development project that began during my private pilot flight training - I wanted a way to easily aggregate
all the weather data that I needed into one place, to supplement proper use of approved aviation weather resources.

The site is mostly designed for personal use/use among friends. Any information on the site should not be used to make final flight
decisions, and should be used to supplement proper weather sources. 

Designed using Twitter Bootstrap and AVWX REST API.
